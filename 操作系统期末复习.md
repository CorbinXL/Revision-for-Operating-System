操作系统期末复习
# 第一章
## 什么是OS
* Consists primarily of:
    * Kernel
    * Systems programs

### Version 1
* A program that 
    * manages computer hardware
    * provides basis for application programs
    * acts as an bridge between computer user and computer hardware

* A resources allocator
    * manage all resources
    * deal with conflict resources request

* A control program
    * control executions of programs to prevent errors and improper use

### Version 2
* An extended machine
    * using abstraction to hide complexity
    * provides high level operation using low level operation

    
* An virtual machine
    * using virtualization to support sharing
    * provides virtual CPU, memory, devices

    
* A resources manager
    * balance overall performance with individual needs

### Version 3
* make computer system easier to use
    * provides interface to run apps
    * protect data
    * provides read/write interface
    * implements TCP/IP stack

* manage the resources of the computer
    * process management
    * memory management
    * storage management
    * protection and security


## Kernel & User Model
### What is Kernel
* another program
* run automatically when you power up your computer
* terminates when you shut down your computer
* Provides lower management of CPU, memory...

### kernel Mode
* full access to all hardware devices
* only OS Kernel runs here

### User Mode
* limited access to hardware
* all process run in this mode 


## Kernel 类型
### Monolithic
* a single large program
* all kernel function can be invoked directly
* very difficult to maintain/extend
* difficult to isolate and debug


### Layered
* each layer provides services to the next higher layers
* layers an change without impacting other layers by not changing the interface
* I/O requires memory management
* Memory management needs I/O

### Microkernel
* a bug in OS kernel can kill the system
* kernel contain minimum function
* remaining functionality is moved to "servers"
* easier to port between hardware platforms
* perform is often poor

### Hypervisor/Virtualization OS
* OS itself is tiny
* services used by user are provided by "normal" OS running in virtual hardware
* can combine many physical servers into one large server
* computing power can be scheduled to where it is needed dynamically


## Kernel如何运行 & 初始化
* Hardware powers up and completes POST(Power On Self Test)
* Microcode in ROM/BIOS performs “bootstrap”
* First-stage boot loader searches devices for second-stage boot loader(PC checks floppy, optical disk, hard disk in some order)
* Second stage boot loader loads and “runs” the OS kernel
* Operating system undertakes initialization then starts one or more standard services to allow the user to interact with the system

# 第二章 Process & Threads
## 定义
### Process & program
he difference is subtle, but absolutely crucial. 

> a computer scientist wants to bake a birthday cake for his daughter
> He has a birthday cake recipe and all the input: flour, eggs, sugar, extract of vanilla, and so on. 

* The recipe is the program
* the computer scientist is the processor (CPU),and the cake ingredients are the input data.
* The process is the activity consisting of our baker reading the recipe, fetching the ingredients, and baking the cake.

### What is process
* processes are **logical resources**
* the concept of process is supported by hardware

### Process Structure
* programs
* Datas
* PCB

## context switch & how often to switch
### what is context & context switch
* all the memory that can be accessed by program code
* switching from one process to another means changing what memory can be accessed

### How often to switch
#### More regular
* OS becomes more responsive
* Waste more time 

#### Less regular
* OS becomes less responsive
* waste less time

### 抢占调度 & 非抢占调度
#### Preemptive Multitasking
* Preempts the currently executing process and save its state
* Change the hardware context to match the next process
* Restore the state of next process and resume its execution

#### Non-Preemptive
* Once a process is in the running state, it will continue until it terminates or blocks itself for I/O

#### Preemptive
* Currently running process may be interrupted and  moved to the Ready state by the operating system

## 各种状态
*ready 到 block 是不可能的*
* Running
* Ready
* Ready suspend
* Blocked
* blocked supend
* New
* Exit

## 进程创建和终止
### When to Create a process
* Submission of a batch job
* User logs on
* Created to provide a service such as printing
* Process creates another process

### The procedure of creation
* Allocate and initialize a **PCB structure**
* Allocate at least three memory regions:
    * Text
    * Data/heap
    * Stack region
* Connect standard input/output streams to the process
* Initialize hardware context to match new process
* Switch to user mode
* set program counter to pre-defined code entry point

### When to terminate process
* Batch job issues Halt instruction
* User logs off
* Quit an application
* Error and fault conditions

### The procedure of termination
* Program invokes a system call to the OS
* OS stores the result in the PCB and frees all memory used by the process
* PCB remains in a ‘terminated’ state until the parent process retrieves the result

## 线程概念 & 优缺点 & 创建和终结


# 第三章 Process Schedule
## 长 中 短程调度
### Long_Term Scheduling
* Determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing
* When will the Scheduling be invoked
    * Each time a job terminates
    * Processor is idle exceeds a certain threshold

### Medium-term Scheduling
* It schedules the process swapped out to disk in memory, ready to execute

### Short-term scheduling
* schedule process to run
* execute most frequently 
* involved when an event occurs 

## 计算密集型 & I/O密集型
* A compute bound process spends most of its time performing computations
	
* An I/O bound process spends most of its time waiting for input or output
	
## 进程调度的概念 & 目标
* Fairness（公平）
* Policy enforcement
    * Some jobs may have unusual requirements
* Balance
    * Keep as much of the system busy as possible
* Throughput（吞吐量）
    * The number of jobs completed per unit of time, e.g., per hour
* Turnaround time（周转时间）
    * The time from when a job is first submitted until it is completes/exits
* CPU utilization
    * Keep the CPU busy/working at all times, an idle CPU is wasted time
    * Remember a context switch is wasted time!
* Response time
    * The time it takes for a program to respond to input, e.g., typing in a command to the shell in Linux
* Proportionality（均衡性）
    * System matches user expectations, e.g., simple jobs are quick, complex jobs take time
* Meeting deadlines
* Predictability（可预测性）

## 调度算法
### FCFS
### SJF(Non-preemptive)
### SRTN(Preemptive)
### RR

# 第四章 存储管理
## 进程如何共享存储
## 交换概念是什么(swap)
* Save out memory contents to disk
* Load next program’s memory contents from disk

### Memory Abstraction
* Processes have an abstract view of memory (logical address space)
* Every logical memory address is then mapped to a physical address (physical address space)
* processes do not work directly with physical memory
Uses hardware support to improve efficiency


## 储存分配算法
first、worst，，，，
### Fixed Partition
* any process whose size is less than or equal to the partition size can be loaded into an available partition.
* if all partitions are full, the operating system can swap a process out of a partition


### Dynamic Partition
* Partitions are of variable length and number.
Process is allocated exactly as much memory as required.
* Eventually get holes in the memory. This is called external fragmentation(外零头).
* Must use compaction(紧凑) to shift processes so they are contiguous and all free memory is in one block.

#### Buddy System
略



### Dynamic Partitioning

## 各种算法的特点
first号next易混淆
## Virtual Memory 概念
* Processes access virtual address space
* Virtual address space is mapped to the physical address space by:
    * Hardware: The MMU(Memory Management Unit) translates virtual memory addresses to physical addresses
    * Software: The operating system configures and manages the MMU
* The virtual address space is broken up into small, fixed size chunks known as pages

## 了解TLB
* Contains page table entries that have been most recently used.
* Functions same way as a  memory cache.
* Given a virtual address, processor examines the TLB.
* If page table entry is present (a hit), the frame number is retrieved and the real address is formed.
* If page table entry is not found in the TLB (a miss), the page number is used to index the process page table.
* First checks if page is already in main memory .
    * if not in main memory a page fault is issued.
* The TLB is updated to include the new page entry.
